Book inventory Management System

Create a python server-based web application (Database + API + frontend) for book inventory management. Imagine you are managing a bookstore and need to keep track of inventory (i.e., number of copies) you have on every book. Details of any book can be found by using Google Book API (Please explore how to integrate APIs of Google). On the backend, you need to keep track of books (along with their respective ID from Google Book API) and their inventory count. When a book stock goes to zero, it is considered out of stock.


Build a web portal, login, and admin are not required, just a public portal where a user can directly interact with it. Here are the features of the portal,

List out all the books in inventory.


    Make changes to inventory:

    Add a new book.

    Update inventory for an existing book.

    Remove from the inventory.
